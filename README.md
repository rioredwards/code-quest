## Features

* **Choose Your Own Adventure**: Users can have quests generated completely at random, or they may specify certain parameters, such as the time limit, and the programming language.
* **Realistic Challenges**: Code Quest will never create a quest that doesn't make sense (e.g. CLI quest using React). A sophisticated algorithm ensures that any quest generated is feasible.
* **Intuitive UI**: The UI was designed to resemble a slot machine, giving the app a familiar feel and making it easy to get started. If you do get stuck, there is a built-in help menu to explain the various features.
* **Smooth Animations**: This app makes heavy use of the Framer Motion animation library, which brings the UI to life!
* **Custom Artwork**: All artwork is custom-made, giving Code Quest a unique look and feel.

## Reflection

Since I started on my coding journey, I've always been drawn to learning tools that use [Gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) in some form to teach coding concepts ([some examples](https://github.com/rioredwards/code-quest#gamification-examples)). I find that I learn best when I'm having fun, and I wanted to create a tool that would help others learn in the same way.

This was the first time since attending a coding boot camp that I've gotten to focus as much on the design and UI of an application as the technical "business logic". I have a love for design and art, so it was really fun to get to flex those muscles again.

It was also the first time I used Framer Motion. This library is really powerful and I enjoyed diving into it. Getting a convincing "Infinite Scroll" effect on the reels was pretty tricky, but in that process, I learned about some of the more advanced features of Framer Motion and gained a deeper understanding of creating animations in code, more generally.

I also gained an appreciation for the process of creating "proof-of-concepts" before attempting to implement certain features into a project. I tried to predict what the most challenging aspects of creating this app might be and created prototypes in a throwaway file or code sandbox. This saved me a lot of time and frustration in the long run.

I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills. ✅
